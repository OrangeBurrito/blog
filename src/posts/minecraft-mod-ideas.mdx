Do you dabble in the ancient and noble tradition of crafting Minecraft Modifications™?
Do you lack ideas to spice up your product and are reading this obscure blog?
If so, this may be the blog post for you!

These are a hodgepodge of the ideas brewing in the dark cavern of my skull, in blog form. 
Go ahead and use them however you like, apart from patenting them. (No one likes a patent troll!)

## Trash Can!
![The Trash Can from Extra Utilities 2 (https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Extra_Utilities_2)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ftb_gamepedia/images/7/77/Block_Trash_Can.png)

- a **Trash Can** but with an opening animation similar to a chests'. It has the metallic thud! closing sound

- inside GUI has less slots than a chest, and has a slot for **garbage bags**.
- **Garbage Bags** can be crafted with paper. (Industrial versions can be made with plastic, and produce 2x more.)
- in order to take the trash out, there must be at least one garbage bag in the slot

- shift right click to take out, this will trigger a block animation and you will get a filled garbage bag
- the filled garbage bag will have all the items in the trash can
- go ahead and drop the bag in some lava or a cactus!

- when there are garbage bags in the slot, the model will change to have garbage bags that change depending on how many are inside
- max garbage bag model is 8

- upgrade trash can to large trash can (also for incinerator/auto-incinerator trash can)
- large trash can takes either regular or large garbage bags, but regular bags will only take half the trash out

- can be connected to hoppers and droppers to throw into lava

- **Lava-powered Incinerator Trash Can** (glowing inside and animated water?)
- destroy everything inside by shift-right clicking or pushing a button/lever (will have smoke particles and a tsss! noise)
- has to be refilled with lava, a lava GUI bar is inside (one bucket fills it, has 4 charges)
- upgradeable to hold more lava

- **Automatic Incinerator Trash Can** (powered by lava and redstone, can use redstone flux or other energy sources)
- automatically destroys everything inside 30 seconds after put in (configurable)

- you can dump trash in an empty or almost empty composter, changes model! (works with recycling trash too, but it's much slower)

- **Recycling Bin**
- comes in blue, green or yellow (dyeable)
- maybe feature: only allow items of a certain category, for modders use the plastic/glass/paper tags (configurable)
- accepts regular garbage bags but feels better if you use renewable garbage bags
- possible recycling machine/mechanic? huge potential with tech mods (mekanism, create (go down the conveyor belt!), immersive engineering)
- [IndustrialCraft 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/industrial-craft) throwback! The machine produces scrap, which can be used to make scrap boxes.
- [**Scrap Boxes**](https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Scrap_(IndustrialCraft_2)) are from IC2.

## Moai Statues (mob)
A throwback to Tropicraft!

- Only spawn/generate on islands.
- Appears to be just a structure until you try to break it with a pick (hitting with swords or axes doesn't turn it hostile).
- Will turn hostile and attempt to squash you to death.  If it jumps on you, deals huge damage (regular hitting not so much)
- Only pickaxes/mining gadgets work with this mob, swords do nothing
- Mining gadgets can do massive damage to this mob. If highly leveled, can kill in a single hit
- Has damaged model in stages, similar to an iron golem (drops chunk o' head each time the model changes)
- when killed, drops chunk o' head (or just stone? to be determined...)
- To turn it neutral, 
- Moai Statues won't  attack you if you're wearing a Moai hat (crafted with chunk o' head)
- Moai Hat has a tall hitbox, you have to crouch to walk through two block corridors

## Bicycles and Unicycles
- *Dyeable seats* (metal depends on the material), made of iron, steel, aluminium or titanium(constructed in parts, similar to Simple Planes' planes).  You can also use a saddle
- **Bicycles** can only seat one player unless you use the two-seater back attachment (second player rides like a boat)
- **Unicycles** are hard to control and you must constantly balance forwards and backwards (W and A) to keep from falling
- If you fall off, the unicycle entity despawns and drops itself and any attachments. If you fall off a cliff... good luck!
- **Mini Clown Bike!** Similar to a tricycle but hilariously small
- It should only be able to seat one player, but if you're wearing a Saddle Hat, it can do two!
- **Ye Olden Days Bike (or Pennyfarthing)** Works like a regular bicycle, but you sit really high up and the front wheel is humungous

## Saddle Hat
- A helmet that allows other players to sit on your head! (Follows BipedHead rotation, custom model)
- Riding players can control your movement with a diamond-on-a-stick! (configurable)
- Looks absolutely ridiculous! Perhaps a two-seater Saddle Hat is in order?
- *Maybe feature*: Players sitting on a saddle hat who are also equipped with saddle hats can drive other players (might be a diamond-on-a-stick conflict here, who knows)

## Gramophone/Phonograph
Like a jukebox but more stylish! 
Are you noticing an antique theme here?

- Insert music discs by right clicking on the block
- It shows up and starts spinning with a texture animation and plays the disc
- Crafted akin to a jukebox, but without the top 3 wood blocks and a Gramophone Horn
(insert crafting recipe image for both items)

## Dungeoning in the Gungeoning
The most satisfying weapons from Enter the Gungeon brought to Minceraft!

- **Casey**, the overpowered red bat from Gungeon.
- Won't fire unless you hold down left click, which starts the charging animation and audio.
- Keep holding down left click and the bat will stay charged, until you release it.
- On release, the mob(s) your cursor is facing (or in the general direction of) get thwacked into the stratosphere at sound-barrier-breaking speeds (depending on where  you're aiming)
- The mob will die after it hits another block (excluding grass/flowers/foliage) or another mob. The poor bystander will also perish instantly upon contact.
- Casey can reflect arrows/projectiles on hit.
- You can upgrade casey to have nails, which will change the model to be of a red-yellow baseball bat studded with nails.
- On firing with  this version, it will shoot a spray of nails in the direction you're facing. These do slightly less damage than a regular arrow.
- Curse (hostile mobs that spawn closest to you will have a chance to be Jammed, if you have the bat in your inventory (maybe?))
- **Railgun**, the prototype version and regular. Both work by charging up.
- The prototype version has a stream of converging lines in the charging animation that line up.
- The regular does not, but the projectile can bounce across the room (if shot in the open, it will whizz in one direction, and terminates after 30 blocks or so)
- **Sunlight Javelin**. \\[T]/ Similar charging mechanism, but you can taste the sun!
- **Meatbun**, a food item that upon eating restores four hearts. (added in Collectibles 0.1-BETA)

## Spawning girls out of vines??
- **Maidenhair** is a vine that can be found in jungles and the occasional forest.
- Using a sacred incantion (you can use botania's mana), you can turn a lowly splodge of vines into a lovely green maiden! (pun intended)
- The maiden will look similar to a villager, but without the nose. (No, you can't smooch her!)
- She wanders the forests and attracts birds with her singing in the morning.
- Using shears, you can harvest some maidenhair vines from her head.
- Maidenhair can be eaten plain or brewed into a medicine if "essential oils" is your jam.
- The medicine in question works by the power of placebo! It has a 1/5 chance to fail, and a 1/20 chance to worsen your affliction.
- It can lower poison, wither, or nausea duration.
- Maidenhair can be turned into Syrup of Maidenhair with sugar/honey. It can be used as a substitute for honey in recipes.
- Syrup of Maidenhair can make Capilè, a Portuguese drink made with lemon zest and cold water.
- The maiden(s) can have a few personality types.
    - The Normal (regular maiden, nothing notable to speak of)
    - The Carefree (likes to run around and isn't as afraid of hostile mobs)
		- The Meek (more shy and skittish, tends to run a bit with movements that are too sudden, afraid of hostile mobs)
		- The Bold (not at all afraid of players or villagers, will fight you if you attack her. (calm her down by giving her snowballs/melonsicles) Doesn't mind hostile mobs)
    - The Emo (created by adding a wither rose to the incantation. Favorite gift is Ghast Tear)
    - The Rapunzel (the hair can grow to be VERY long, which results in more maidenhair to harvest)
    - The Angelic (created  by adding a pure daisy to the incantation, has a halo above her head. Birds love her!)
    - The VSCO (something went wrong! This can happen if there are pumpkin spice lattes or flower crowns near the incantation site)
    - The Man (wait a minute... This isn't a beautiful maiden!)
- Gifts Mechanic: Each maiden type likes a specific gift. You can give gifts once every two days (configurable)
- The more gifts you give maidens, the more likely they will be to reciprocate and give you a rare item.

- A goose that has a small chance to lay a golden egg
