<p class="no-mb">Birds. What are they, and do they really exist?</p>
To answer these burning questions, we have to rip a gash in space-time and steal a TARDIS.
From there, we can dial back the timeometer (don't look at me like that, I never watched Dr. Who)
and go back 200 million years, to the age of the dinosaur. If you think that seems like an
excessive amount of time, keep in mind that it's only twice as long as the time it takes to pass
a law in Congress.

If you don't see any pterodactyls, you may be on the wrong continent. In that case, travel back
to the present and board a plane to the appropriate landmass (you may have to pay extra for the TARDIS luggage costs)

<p class="no-mb">The pterodactyl in its natural habitat. Note the bird next to it, which may allude to either the previously unknown time travel capabilities of hawks, or of the complete buffoonery of the artist.</p>
In the second photo, the skeleton appears to be of the creature shrugging, perhaps to indicate its total ignorance about anything other than eating, sleeping and mating.
(pterosaurs had a smaller brain-to-body mass compared to contemporary birds, which in itself is sitting at a rather unimpressive 1-2%)*





*While researching this, I came across the animal with the smallest brain-to-body mass ratio of all vertebrates.
It's the Bony-eared assfish, which sounds like an apt description of white rappers.
